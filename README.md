Python Flask API for Offline-Online Indicator Design Pattern
This Python Flask API provides a simple implementation of the Offline-Online Indicator Design Pattern. This pattern is used to indicate whether a user's device is currently connected to the internet or not.

The API provides a single endpoint that returns a JSON response indicating whether the device is currently online or offline. The response contains a boolean value (true if the device is online and false if it's offline) and a timestamp indicating the time when the request was processed.
